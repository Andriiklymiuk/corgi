- in required checkCmd && || don't work, use same approach to start commands
- copy dump from seedFromFile (don't remember its name), if corgi db seed is used
- if there is a path and no cloneFrom, so open this service path and not create new folder of name service
- probably in make seed command don't pass id if docker service and just get it in line itself (check mysql)
