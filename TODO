- add environmentAliases, so that you can override env values, for example
  if service requires AMPQ_PORT and i will add to this service enc REDIS_PORT, so in environmentAliases i can write
  - AMPQ_PORT=${REDIS_PORT}
  if i need WEBHOOK_URL and it uses ws://${API_URL}, than i will be able to write in environmentAliases
  - WEBHOOK_URL=ws://${API_URL}
- in required checkCmd && || don't work, use same approach to start commands
- copy dump from seedFromFile (don't remember its name), if corgi db seed is used
- if there is a path and no cloneFrom, so open this service path and not create new folder of name service
- probably in make seed command don't pass id if docker service and just get it in line itself (check mysql)
