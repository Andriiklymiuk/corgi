# Health checks

Health checking runs through the `corgi status` command (aliases: `health`, `healthcheck`). It's a separate, synchronous pass — `corgi run` does not wait for services to become healthy before reporting "running."

## How probing works

For every `services.<name>` and `db_services.<name>` that declares a `port:`, `corgi status` probes:

1. **No `healthCheck:` key** → TCP connect to `localhost:<port>`. Healthy if the connect succeeds.
2. **`healthCheck: /some/path`** → HTTP GET `http://localhost:<port><path>`. Healthy on any non-5xx response. 2xx, 3xx, 4xx all pass.
3. **`driver: localstack` with no override** → HTTP GET `/_localstack/health`. This is the ONLY built-in default URL. Override by setting `healthCheck:` explicitly.

corgi has no supabase special-casing. **Recommended for supabase**: set `healthCheck: /rest/v1/` yourself. Returns 401 (kong rejects unauth requests), corgi accepts non-5xx as healthy. Without it you get a plain TCP probe on :54321, which races kong startup.

**Skipped, never probed**: any `manualRun` service AND any `manualRun` db_service — `corgi status` ignores them entirely.

**Probe timeouts**: TCP connect = 500ms. HTTP GET = 5s.

## Syntax

```yaml
services:
  api:
    port: 3000
    healthCheck: /health        # path only, no scheme or host

db_services:
  app-db:
    driver: postgres
    port: 5432
    # no healthCheck → TCP probe on 5432
```

## Exit codes

- `corgi status` exits **0** if every probed target is healthy.
- Exits **1** if any single target fails — a worker with port 3001 down will fail the whole command even if everything else is fine.

## Watch + ready modes

- `corgi status -w` (alias `--watch`) loops. In a TTY it does a FULL in-place table redraw each tick (alternate screen buffer, top-line clear). When stdout is piped/non-TTY, or with `--json` or `--quiet`, it falls back to append-only transition lines (kubectl-style) instead of redrawing. Tunable via `-i, --interval` (default 2s). Ctrl+C exits.
- `corgi status -r` (aliases `--ready`, `--until-healthy`) loops until every target is up — exits 0 when all green, exits 1 on `--timeout` (default 5m). CI-friendly block-until-ready gate.
- `--service api,web` narrows the probed set. Matches the BARE name — strips the `db_services.`/`services.` prefix and any ` (driver)` suffix before comparing, so it filters db_services too. Use with `--ready` when iterating on one service.
- `--ready`/`--watch` probe all targets in PARALLEL each tick. The one-shot pass (plain `corgi status`) is sequential.
- `--json` switches output: one-shot JSON array; watch/ready emit NDJSON one-per-transition.
- `-q, --quiet` suppresses output; rely on exit code only.

Output is colored text — results to stdout, load/config errors to stderr (no JSON unless `--json`):

```
🩺 corgi status
  ✅ db_services.app-db          localhost:5432 listening
  ✅ services.api                http://localhost:3000/health [HTTP 200]
  ❌ services.worker             http://localhost:3001/health [HTTP 503]
1 down, 2 up — check `corgi run` logs for the failing services.
```

## Why a healthCheck is failing (fast triage)

- `[HTTP 5xx]` → the service is up but its handler is erroring. Check logs from `corgi run`; don't blame corgi.
- `localhost:<port> not listening` → the service never bound the port (TCP probe failed). Either it crashed during boot, or it's listening on a different port than `services.<name>.port` declares.
- HTTP transport errors — the reason is exactly one of `timeout`, `connection refused`, or `no response` → corgi couldn't even complete the GET. Service not up yet, wrong port, or it dropped the connection.
- `[HTTP 404]` → path doesn't exist, but corgi treats any non-5xx (incl. 404) as HEALTHY. So a 404 on your `/health` route still passes the probe while meaning you haven't implemented it. Point `healthCheck:` at a real route or drop it to fall back to TCP.
- `localstack` shows ❌ but container is up → localstack services boot async; give it a few seconds after `corgi run` before probing.

## When to add healthCheck

- **A `sleep` in `beforeStart`/`start` is a readiness gap wearing a costume.** Replace it with the real primitive: `healthCheck:` (or a `warmup:` block for a server that builds on first request), `corgi db --upAll --wait` for databases, `corgi run --wait` in scripts. A sleep tuned on one machine fails on a slower one and wastes time on a faster one.
- **Add it for services** where "port open" isn't enough — e.g. a Rails server binds the port long before migrations finish.
- **Skip it for databases** unless you have a specific readiness endpoint. TCP probing is usually sufficient for postgres/mysql/redis/etc.
- **Always set it on localstack** if you've overridden the default port or disabled the health service, to avoid probing a non-existent endpoint.
